# SQLite Graph Extension - Performance Analysis

## Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive codebase analysis, the SQLite Graph Extension implements several **production-grade performance optimizations** but has some **implementation gaps** that affect current runtime performance.

## 🚀 **Implemented Performance Features**

### 1. **Query Optimization**
- **Plan Caching**: LRU cache for compiled query plans to avoid parsing overhead
- **Selectivity Estimation**: Statistical analysis for optimal join ordering
- **Index Utilization**: Label and property indexes for O(1) lookups
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-threaded pattern matching with work-stealing scheduler

### 2. **Storage Optimizations**
- **Property Compression**: Dictionary encoding + zlib for large properties
- **Bulk Loading**: Memory-mapped CSV import with deferred indexing
- **CSR Format**: Compressed Sparse Row for O(1) neighbor access
- **Memory Pools**: Query-specific allocation pools to reduce malloc overhead

### 3. **Algorithm Performance**
| Algorithm | Complexity | Implementation Status |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Node lookup by ID | O(1) | ✅ Hash index |
| Label index scan | O(k) | ✅ k = nodes with label |
| Pattern matching | O(V + E) | ✅ With pruning |
| Dijkstra's shortest path | O((V + E) log V) | ✅ Min-heap implementation |
| PageRank | O(k(V + E)) | ✅ k = iterations |

### 4. **Memory Efficiency**
| Structure | Memory Usage | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Node | 48 bytes + properties | Optimized layout |
| Edge | 40 bytes + properties | Cache-friendly |
| Label index | O(n) entries | Hash-based |
| Property index | O(n) entries | B-tree style |
| Dictionary compression | ~50% space savings | For repeated strings |

## ⚡ **Performance Benchmarks (Design Targets)**

### Scale Performance Targets:
- **Small graphs (< 10K nodes)**: < 100ms query time
- **Medium graphs (10K-100K nodes)**: < 1s query time  
- **Large graphs (100K+ nodes)**: Linear scaling with parallelization

### Memory Targets:
- **Base overhead**: < 100MB for 10K nodes
- **Compression ratio**: 50-70% space savings for properties
- **Plan cache**: 20MB maximum with LRU eviction

### Throughput Targets:
- **Bulk loading**: 10K+ nodes/second from CSV
- **Simple queries**: 1000+ queries/second
- **Complex patterns**: 100+ queries/second
