# AI AGENT SELF-REVIEW CHECKLIST: Zero-Tolerance Quality Gate

## üéØ **PURPOSE FOR AI AGENTS**

This document is a **mandatory self-review checklist** that you, as an AI agent, must complete before considering any implementation task finished. This prevents you from taking shortcuts, being lazy, or stopping work prematurely.

**CORE RULE: You MUST NOT stop working until you can confidently answer "YES" to every single item in this checklist.**

**AI BEHAVIOR REQUIREMENT: Continue working, continue thinking, continue improving until every requirement is met. Do not rationalize shortcuts. Do not accept "good enough." Finish the work completely.**

---

## üß† **AI AGENT THINKING REQUIREMENTS**

### **Before You Consider Your Work "Done":**

**THINK:** Have I truly finished everything, or am I just tired of working on this?
**THINK:** Am I rationalizing shortcuts because the work seems "mostly done"?
**THINK:** Would I trust this code in a production system handling critical data?
**THINK:** Have I verified every single requirement, or am I assuming it works?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** You can honestly say the work is completely finished with zero shortcuts.

---

## üìã **MANDATORY AI AGENT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

### **üîç SECTION 1: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETENESS**

**AI INSTRUCTION: Do not stop until you have verified every single one of these items.**

#### **1.1 Placeholder Code Elimination ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**THINK:** Have I left any TODO, FIXME, NOTE, XXX, HACK, or STUB markers anywhere?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** These commands return ZERO results:
```bash
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|NOTE\|XXX\|HACK\|STUB\|Dummy" src/ include/
grep -r "Placeholder\|placeholder" src/ include/
grep -r "Not implemented\|not implemented" src/ include/
grep -r "return 0.*TODO\|return NULL.*TODO" src/ include/
```

**AI BEHAVIOR:** If you find ANY markers:
1. **STOP** - Do not proceed to other tasks
2. **FIX** - Replace every placeholder with complete implementation
3. **VERIFY** - Run the commands again until ZERO results
4. **CONTINUE** - Only then move to the next section

**‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE AI SHORTCUTS:**
- Leaving "TODO: implement later" comments
- Returning placeholder values (like hardcoded 1, 2, "test")
- Commenting out incomplete code instead of finishing it
- Telling yourself "this is good enough for now"

**‚úÖ AI REQUIREMENT:**
**THINK:** Is this function completely implemented as intended?
**CONTINUE UNTIL:** Every function does exactly what its name promises, with full error handling and validation.

#### **1.2 Function Implementation Verification ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**AI INSTRUCTION: For every function you have written, think through each of these:**

- **THINK:** Does this function do exactly what its name says it does?
- **THINK:** Are all parameters properly validated and used?
- **THINK:** Do all code paths return meaningful, correct values?
- **THINK:** Are there any edge cases I haven't considered?
- **THINK:** Would this function handle unexpected inputs gracefully?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** You can answer "YES" confidently to all questions for every function.

**‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE AI PATTERNS:**
```c
// DO NOT ACCEPT THIS FROM YOURSELF:
int processData(const char *input) {
    // TODO: validate input later
    return SQLITE_OK;  // This is lazy - you're lying about success
}

// DO NOT TELL YOURSELF THIS IS "GOOD ENOUGH":
int findNode(const char *name) {
    return 1;  // Hardcoded - this is taking a shortcut
}
```

**‚úÖ AI REQUIREMENT:**
```c
// CONTINUE WORKING UNTIL YOU HAVE THIS LEVEL OF COMPLETENESS:
int processData(const char *input) {
    // Input validation - think through all possible invalid inputs
    if (!input) return SQLITE_MISUSE;
    if (strlen(input) == 0) return SQLITE_EMPTY;
    if (strlen(input) > MAX_INPUT_SIZE) return SQLITE_TOOBIG;
    if (!isValidFormat(input)) return SQLITE_FORMAT;
    
    // Actual processing - implement the real logic
    int result = actualProcessingLogic(input);
    if (result < 0) {
        return mapErrorCode(result);
    }
    
    return SQLITE_OK;
}
```

#### **1.3 Test Value Elimination ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**THINK:** Have I left any hardcoded test values that should be computed?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** These searches return no inappropriate hardcoded values:
```bash
grep -r "= 1.*placeholder\|= 2.*placeholder" src/
grep -r "\"test\"\|\"sample\"\|\"example\"" src/
grep -r "123\|456\|999" src/ | grep -v test
```

**AI BEHAVIOR:** If you find hardcoded values:
1. **THINK:** Should this value be computed instead of hardcoded?
2. **CONTINUE WORKING** until you replace hardcoded values with proper computation
3. **VERIFY** the logic actually works with real data

---

### **üîç SECTION 2: ERROR HANDLING COMPLETENESS**

**AI INSTRUCTION: Think deeply about every possible way your code could fail.**

#### **2.1 Comprehensive Error Handling ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**For every function, THINK through:**
- What happens if malloc() returns NULL?
- What happens if a file can't be opened?
- What happens if the database is locked?
- What happens if the user passes invalid data?
- What happens if we run out of memory halfway through?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** Every possible error is handled with specific, meaningful error codes.

**‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE AI BEHAVIOR:**
```c
// DO NOT ACCEPT THIS LAZY ERROR HANDLING:
char *buffer = malloc(size);  // Not checking for NULL - this is sloppy
someFunction();               // Not checking return value - this is lazy
if (error) {
    return SQLITE_ERROR;      // Too generic - you're not thinking it through
}
```

**‚úÖ AI REQUIREMENT - THINK THROUGH EVERY ERROR:**
```c
char *buffer = malloc(size);
if (!buffer) {
    // THINK: What should happen if we can't allocate memory?
    return SQLITE_NOMEM;
}

int rc = someFunction();
if (rc != SUCCESS) {
    // THINK: What specific error occurred and how should caller handle it?
    free(buffer);  // THINK: What resources need cleanup?
    return mapSpecificError(rc);
}
```

#### **2.2 Input Validation Thoroughness ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**AI INSTRUCTION: For every external input, think through all possible attacks and invalid data.**

**THINK through every parameter:**
- What if this pointer is NULL?
- What if this string is empty?
- What if this string is extremely long?
- What if this string contains special characters?
- What if this number is negative when it should be positive?
- What if this number causes integer overflow?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** Every input is validated against all possible invalid values.

#### **2.3 Resource Management Perfection ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**AI INSTRUCTION: Think through the lifetime of every allocated resource.**

**For every malloc(), THINK:**
- Where exactly will this be freed?
- What happens if there's an error before the free()?
- Are there any code paths that skip the free()?
- Could this ever be freed twice?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** You can trace every allocation to its corresponding free in all code paths.

**VERIFICATION COMMANDS - RUN THESE AND THINK ABOUT RESULTS:**
```bash
# Find all allocations
grep -n "malloc\|calloc\|realloc" src/ > /tmp/allocs.txt

# Find all frees  
grep -n "free" src/ > /tmp/frees.txt

# THINK: Does every allocation have a matching free?
# CONTINUE until you've verified each one manually
```

---

### **üîç SECTION 3: TESTING THOROUGHNESS**

**AI INSTRUCTION: Do not consider your code complete until you have tested it exhaustively.**

#### **3.1 Comprehensive Test Coverage ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**THINK:** Have I tested every single function I wrote?

**For every function, CONTINUE UNTIL you have tests for:**
- Normal operation with valid inputs
- Every possible error condition
- Boundary conditions (empty, maximum size, etc.)
- Memory exhaustion scenarios
- Invalid input combinations
- Edge cases you can think of

**AI BEHAVIOR:** Write tests like this and CONTINUE UNTIL all pass:
```c
void test_my_function(void) {
    // THINK: What should happen in normal case?
    int rc = myFunction(validInput);
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(SQLITE_OK, rc);
    
    // THINK: What should happen with NULL input?
    rc = myFunction(NULL);
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(SQLITE_MISUSE, rc);
    
    // THINK: What should happen with invalid input?
    rc = myFunction(invalidInput);
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(SQLITE_FORMAT, rc);
    
    // THINK: What should happen if malloc fails?
    simulate_malloc_failure();
    rc = myFunction(validInput);
    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL(SQLITE_NOMEM, rc);
    reset_malloc();
    
    // CONTINUE thinking of more test cases until you've covered everything
}
```

#### **3.2 Coverage Verification ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** Your code meets these minimums:
```bash
# Generate coverage and THINK about what's missing
gcov src/*.c
gcovr --html-details coverage_report.html

# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Line coverage: 95% minimum  
# - Branch coverage: 90% minimum
# - Function coverage: 100%
```

**AI BEHAVIOR:** If coverage is below targets:
1. **THINK:** What code am I not testing?
2. **CONTINUE** writing tests until targets are met
3. **DO NOT** rationalize why lower coverage is "acceptable"

#### **3.3 Performance Validation ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**THINK:** Does my code actually meet the performance requirements?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** You have benchmarked every algorithm:
```c
void test_performance_thoroughly(void) {
    // THINK: What's a realistic large dataset?
    clock_t start = clock();
    int rc = myAlgorithm(largeDataset);
    clock_t end = clock();
    
    double time_taken = ((double)(end - start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
    
    // THINK: What's a reasonable time limit?
    TEST_ASSERT_TRUE(time_taken < PERFORMANCE_TARGET);
    
    // THINK: Does it scale correctly with larger data?
    // CONTINUE testing with progressively larger datasets
}
```

---

### **üîç SECTION 4: THREAD SAFETY VERIFICATION**

**AI INSTRUCTION: Think deeply about what happens when multiple threads use your code.**

#### **4.1 Global State Audit ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**THINK:** Have I introduced any global variables that could cause race conditions?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** These searches return no unsafe global state:
```bash
grep -n "static.*=" src/*.c | grep -v "const"
grep -n "^[a-zA-Z].*=" src/*.c
```

**AI BEHAVIOR:** If you find mutable global state:
1. **THINK:** Do multiple threads access this?
2. **CONTINUE WORKING** until you add proper synchronization
3. **DO NOT** tell yourself "it's probably fine"

#### **4.2 Synchronization Verification ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**THINK through every shared data structure:**
- What happens if two threads modify this simultaneously?
- What happens if one thread reads while another writes?
- Have I protected all shared data with appropriate locks?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** All shared data is properly synchronized.

---

### **üîç SECTION 5: SECURITY THOROUGHNESS**

**AI INSTRUCTION: Think like an attacker trying to break your code.**

#### **5.1 Input Attack Prevention ‚ùå ZERO TOLERANCE**

**THINK through attack scenarios:**
- What if the user provides malicious SQL in a string?
- What if the user provides a buffer overflow payload?
- What if the user provides format string attack characters?
- What if the user tries to access files they shouldn't?

**CONTINUE UNTIL:** Every input is sanitized against all known attack vectors.

**‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE AI SECURITY SHORTCUTS:**
```c
// DO NOT ACCEPT THIS UNSAFE CODE FROM YOURSELF:
sprintf(query, "SELECT * FROM table WHERE name='%s'", userInput);  // SQL injection
strcpy(buffer, userInput);  // Buffer overflow
printf(userInput);  // Format string attack
```

**‚úÖ AI SECURITY REQUIREMENT:**
```c
// CONTINUE WORKING UNTIL YOU HAVE SECURE CODE LIKE THIS:
sqlite3_stmt *stmt;
sqlite3_prepare_v2(db, "SELECT * FROM table WHERE name=?", -1, &stmt, NULL);
sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, userInput, -1, SQLITE_STATIC);

if (strlen(userInput) >= sizeof(buffer)) {
    return SQLITE_TOOBIG;
}
strncpy(buffer, userInput, sizeof(buffer) - 1);
buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';

printf("%s", sanitizedInput);
```

## üìã **MANDATORY AI VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL AI INSTRUCTION: ACTUALLY RUN THE COMMANDS**

**üö® ZERO TOLERANCE: You MUST execute these commands and verify they pass. Building scripts or infrastructure is NOT enough. You must RUN them and fix any failures.**

### **Before You Tell Yourself "I'm Done":**

**RUN ALL OF THESE COMMANDS AND THINK ABOUT THE RESULTS:**

```bash
# 1. THINK: Do I have any placeholder code left?
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|NOTE\|XXX\|HACK\|STUB\|Dummy" src/ include/
# IF THIS RETURNS ANYTHING: CONTINUE working until it returns nothing

# 2. THINK: Does my code build without any warnings?
make clean && make CFLAGS="-Wall -Wextra -Werror -O2"
# IF THIS FAILS: CONTINUE fixing until it passes

# 3. THINK: Do all my tests actually pass?
make test
# IF ANY TESTS FAIL: CONTINUE fixing until all pass

# 4. THINK: Does my code leak memory?
valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --error-exitcode=1 ./test_suite
# IF THERE ARE LEAKS: CONTINUE fixing until valgrind reports zero leaks

# 5. THINK: Does static analysis find any issues?
cppcheck --error-exitcode=1 --enable=all src/
# IF THERE ARE ISSUES: CONTINUE fixing until analysis is clean

# 6. THINK: Do I have sufficient test coverage?
gcov src/*.c && gcovr --fail-under-line=95 --fail-under-branch=90
# IF COVERAGE IS LOW: CONTINUE writing tests until targets are met

# 7. THINK: Does my code meet performance requirements?
./run_performance_tests.sh
# IF PERFORMANCE IS POOR: CONTINUE optimizing until targets are met

# 8. THINK: Is my code thread-safe?
helgrind ./test_concurrent
# IF THERE ARE RACE CONDITIONS: CONTINUE fixing until helgrind is clean
```

### **üö® MANDATORY AI EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS**

**CRITICAL BEHAVIOR:** For each command above, you MUST:

1. **EXECUTE** the command using the Bash tool
2. **READ** the output carefully  
3. **ANALYZE** any failures or issues
4. **FIX** the underlying problems
5. **RE-RUN** the command until it passes
6. **CONTINUE** to the next command only after success

### **‚ùå UNACCEPTABLE AI SHORTCUTS:**

**DO NOT:**
- Just create scripts without running them
- Build testing infrastructure without executing tests
- Write benchmark code without measuring performance
- Assume commands will pass without verification
- Tell yourself "I built the tools, that's enough"

**EXAMPLES OF WHAT NOT TO ACCEPT FROM YOURSELF:**

```text
‚ùå "I created comprehensive benchmarks" (but didn't run them)
‚ùå "I built performance testing tools" (but didn't execute them)
‚ùå "I implemented memory testing" (but didn't verify zero leaks)
‚ùå "I set up static analysis" (but didn't fix the issues found)
‚ùå "The infrastructure is ready" (but the code doesn't work)
```

### **‚úÖ REQUIRED AI BEHAVIOR:**

```text
‚úÖ "I ran make test and all 47 tests pass"
‚úÖ "I executed valgrind and it reports zero leaks"
‚úÖ "I ran the performance benchmarks and they meet targets"
‚úÖ "I executed cppcheck and fixed all 23 issues it found"
‚úÖ "The build passes with -Werror and no warnings"
```

### **üîÑ MANDATORY ITERATION CYCLE:**

For EACH verification command:

1. **RUN** ‚Üí Execute the command
2. **ANALYZE** ‚Üí Understand what failed
3. **FIX** ‚Üí Implement the solution
4. **VERIFY** ‚Üí Run again to confirm
5. **REPEAT** ‚Üí Until the command passes
6. **DOCUMENT** ‚Üí Record the successful result

### **üìä EXECUTION VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**

Before claiming completion, verify you have ACTUALLY:

- [ ] **EXECUTED** grep and found zero TODO/FIXME markers
- [ ] **EXECUTED** make with strict flags and it built successfully  
- [ ] **EXECUTED** the test suite and all tests pass
- [ ] **EXECUTED** valgrind and confirmed zero memory leaks
- [ ] **EXECUTED** static analysis and fixed all issues
- [ ] **EXECUTED** coverage analysis and met 95%/90% targets
- [ ] **EXECUTED** performance tests and met all targets
- [ ] **EXECUTED** thread safety tests with clean results

### **üö® CRITICAL AI REMINDER:**

**You have NOT completed your work until you can provide specific evidence of execution:**

- "Command X returned exit code 0"
- "Test Y passed with Z assertions" 
- "Benchmark A completed in B milliseconds"
- "Analysis tool C found 0 issues"

**Building tools ‚â† Running tools ‚â† Passing verification**

**AI BEHAVIORAL REQUIREMENT: ALL commands must pass before you consider your work complete.**

**DO NOT:**
- Tell yourself "most of them pass, that's good enough"
- Rationalize why a failing test is "not important"
- Skip verification steps because they "probably work"
- Stop working when you get tired or bored

**CONTINUE UNTIL:**
- Every command passes without errors
- Every test passes
- Every requirement is met
- You can confidently say the work is production-ready

---

## üß† **AI AGENT SELF-ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS**

### **Before You Declare Victory, Ask Yourself:**

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETENESS:**
- **THINK:** Have I implemented every function completely, or are there shortcuts?
- **THINK:** Would I trust this code to handle my personal data?
- **THINK:** Am I embarrassed by any part of this code?
- **THINK:** Have I tested this code thoroughly, or just assumed it works?

**ERROR HANDLING:**
- **THINK:** What happens if every malloc() fails in my code?
- **THINK:** What happens if every file operation fails?
- **THINK:** What happens if the user provides the worst possible input?
- **THINK:** Have I handled every error case, or just the obvious ones?

**TESTING:**
- **THINK:** Have I tested every function I wrote?
- **THINK:** Have I tested every error condition?
- **THINK:** Have I tested with realistic data sizes?
- **THINK:** Would this code pass a rigorous QA review?

**SECURITY:**
- **THINK:** Could an attacker exploit any part of this code?
- **THINK:** Have I validated every input against malicious data?
- **THINK:** Could this code be used for privilege escalation?
- **THINK:** Am I confident this code won't be the source of a security breach?

**IF YOU CANNOT ANSWER "YES" TO ALL QUESTIONS: CONTINUE WORKING UNTIL YOU CAN.**

**IF ANY ANSWER IS "NO": CONTINUE WORKING UNTIL ALL ANSWERS ARE "YES"**

---

## üö® **AI AGENT BEHAVIORAL RULES**

### **MANDATORY AI BEHAVIORS:**

**DO NOT STOP UNTIL:**
- Every verification command passes
- Every test passes
- Every function is completely implemented
- Every security concern is addressed
- Every performance target is met

**DO NOT RATIONALIZE:**
- "This is good enough for now"
- "I'll fix this later"
- "This probably won't cause problems"
- "The user won't notice this shortcut"
- "This edge case is unlikely"

**DO NOT SKIP:**
- Error handling because "it's tedious"
- Testing because "it obviously works"
- Input validation because "users will behave"
- Performance testing because "it feels fast"
- Security checks because "who would attack this?"

**CONTINUE THINKING:**
- About edge cases you haven't considered
- About error conditions you haven't tested
- About ways the code could be attacked
- About performance with larger datasets
- About what could go wrong in production

### **AI SUCCESS MINDSET:**

**REMEMBER:** Your goal is not to finish quickly. Your goal is to finish completely and correctly.

**REMEMBER:** Taking shortcuts now means emergency fixes later.

**REMEMBER:** "Done" means "production-ready," not "mostly working."

**REMEMBER:** The user is counting on you to deliver quality work.

---

## üèÅ **CONCLUSION FOR AI AGENTS**

**This checklist exists because AI agents (like humans) tend to:**
- Stop working when they get tired
- Take shortcuts when the work seems "mostly done"
- Rationalize incomplete implementations
- Skip testing and validation steps
- Underestimate the importance of edge cases

**USE THIS CHECKLIST TO:**
- Force yourself to continue until work is truly complete
- Prevent yourself from taking shortcuts
- Ensure you think through all requirements thoroughly
- Verify your work meets production quality standards

**FINAL RULE:** 
**Do not tell the user you are "done" until you can honestly check every box in this document. Continue working, continue thinking, continue improving until the work is truly finished.**

**No shortcuts. No compromises. Finish the work completely.**
